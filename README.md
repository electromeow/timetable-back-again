# timetable-back-again
Unfortunately, discord.py library became discontinued. And the Timetable bot includes a ton of bugs hidden in a bunch of shitcode.\
So I'm porting Timetable to Node.js using the library discord.js, but this time faster and less buggy.\
I choose Node.js because Timetable is built over a bunch of async background processes, and Node.js is the best
ecosystem I've ever tried to create an application that is built on a ton of async processes.
